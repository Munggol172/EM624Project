Build a single, reproducible Python pipeline that ingests the FiveThirtyEight gun dataset,
focuses on firearm suicides (2012–2014), engineers analysis variables, produces tables and
visualizations, runs basic statistical checks, and prints out clear findings that can be used
directly in the written report.

High-level stages
1. Environment & folder setup
2. Data ingestion
3. Suicide subset creation
4. Feature engineering & cleaning
5. Descriptive summaries
6. Visualization suite
7. Risk & association analysis
8. Narrative summary for the report
9. Orchestration (main driver)
