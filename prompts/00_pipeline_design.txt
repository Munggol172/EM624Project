# LLM RESPONSE – FINAL PIPELINE DESIGN (7 components)

1. load_data() → reads all CSVs from /data
2. filter_gun_suicides() → keeps only intent == "Suicide" AND police_involved == 0
3. clean_and_engineer_features() → fixes age, bins age groups, cleans education, adds season/month_name
4. exploratory_visualizations() → saves 8 key plots automatically
5. statistical_tests() → chi-square, risk ratios, prints results
6. generate_summary_findings() → prints bullet-point answers for the report
7. main() → runs everything in order and saves plots

All functions are completely independent, documented, and contain the exact LLM prompt used to create them as comments.
